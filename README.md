# Quiz-game

In this quiz game you will be tested by a series of questions giving multiple choices and only one correct answer. For each time you lose the less points you get, whereas the more correct answers you have the better ranking of highscore you will have.

This game is marked by a timer, meaning that incorrect answers will penalize your
score/time by ten seconds.
